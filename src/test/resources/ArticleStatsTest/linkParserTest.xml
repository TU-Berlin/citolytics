        '''Snow''' is [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] in the form of flakes of [[crystal]]line [[water]] [[ice]] that falls from [[cloud]]s. Since snow is composed of small ice particles, it is a [[granular material]]. It has an open and therefore soft, white, and fluffy structure, unless subjected to external [[pressure]]. [[Snowflake]]s come in a variety of sizes and shapes. Types that fall in the form of a ball due to melting and refreezing, rather than a flake, are known as [[hail]], [[ice pellets]] or [[snow grains]].

        The process of precipitating snow is called '''snowfall'''. Snowfall tends to form within regions of upward movement of air around a type of [[low-pressure system]] known as an [[extratropical cyclone]]. Snow can fall poleward of these systems' associated [[warm front]]s and within their comma head precipitation patterns (called such due to the comma-like shape of the cloud and precipitation pattern around the poleward and west sides of extratropical cyclones). Where relatively warm water bodies are present, for example because of water evaporation from lakes, [[lake-effect snow]]fall becomes a concern downwind of the warm lakes within the cold cyclonic flow around the backside of extratropical cyclones. Lake-effect [[snowfall]] can be heavy locally. [[Thundersnow]] is possible within a cyclone's comma head and within lake effect precipitation bands. In mountainous areas, heavy snow is possible where upslope flow is maximized within [[windward]] sides of the terrain at elevation, if the atmosphere is cold enough. Snowfall amount and its related liquid equivalent precipitation amount are measured using a variety of different [[rain gauge]]s.

        Once on the ground, snow can be categorized as powdery when light and fluffy, fresh when recent but heavier, granular when it begins the cycle of melting and refreezing, and eventually [[ice]] once it comes down, after multiple melting and refreezing cycles, into a dense mass called [[snow pack]]. When powdery, snow moves with the [[wind]] from the location where it originally landed, forming deposits called [[snowdrift]]s that may have a depth of several meters. After attaching itself to hillsides, blown snow can evolve into a snow slab—an [[avalanche]] hazard on steep slopes. The existence of a snowpack keeps temperatures lower than they would be otherwise, as the whiteness of the snow reflects most sunlight, and any absorbed heat goes into melting the snow rather than increasing its temperature. The water equivalent of snowfall is measured to monitor how much liquid is available to flood [[river]]s from [[meltwater]] that will occur during the following [[spring (season)|spring]]. Snow cover can protect crops from extreme cold. If snowfall stays on the ground for a series of years uninterrupted, the snowpack develops into a mass of ice called [[glacier]]. Fresh snow absorbs sound, lowering ambient noise over a [[landscape]] because the trapped air between snowflakes attenuates vibration. These acoustic qualities quickly minimize and reverse, once a layer of [[freezing rain]] falls on top of snow cover. Walking across snowfall produces a squeaking sound at low temperatures.

            <!--Not sure where this para belongs-->The energy balance of the snowpack itself is dictated by several heat exchange processes. The snowpack absorbs solar shortwave radiation that is partially blocked by cloud cover and reflected by snow surface. A long-wave heat exchange takes place between the snowpack and its surrounding environment that includes overlying air mass, tree cover and clouds. Heat exchange takes place by [[convection]] between the snowpack and the overlaying air mass, and it is governed by the temperature gradient and wind speed. Moisture exchange between the snowpack and the overlying air mass is accompanied by latent heat transfer that is influenced by vapor pressure gradient and air wind. Rain on snow can add significant amounts of thermal energy to the snowpack. A generally insignificant heat exchange takes place by [[Heat conduction|conduction]] between the snowpack and the ground. The small temperature change from before to after a snowfall is a result of the heat transfer between the snowpack and the air.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.scientificjournals.org/journals2007/articles/1118.pdf|journal=Journal of Engineering, Computing and Architecture|issn=1934-7197|volume=1|issue=1|year=2007|title=Development of an Energy-budget Snowmelt Updating Model for Incorporating Feedback from Snow Course Survey Measurements|author=Hamed Assaf}}</ref> As snow degrades, its surface can develop characteristic ablation textures such as [[Suncup (snow)|suncups]] or [[penitentes]].

        The term ''[[Snow-storm|snow storm]]'' can describe a heavy snowfall, while a ''[[blizzard]]'' involves snow and wind, obscuring visibility. ''Snow shower'' is a term for an intermittent snowfall, while ''[[snow flurry|flurry]]'' is used for very light, brief snowfalls. Snow can fall more than a meter at a time during a single storm in flat areas, and meters at a time in rugged terrain, such as [[mountain]]s. When snow falls in significant quantities, travel by foot, car, airplane and other means becomes severely restricted, but other methods of mobility become possible, such as the use of [[snowmobile]]s, [[snowshoe]]s and [[ski]]s. When heavy snow occurs early in the [[fall]] (or, on rarer occasions, late in the [[spring (season)|spring]]), significant damage can occur to trees still in leaf. Areas with significant snow each year can store the winter snow within an [[ice house (building)|ice house]], which can be used to cool structures during the following [[summer]]. A variation on snow has been observed on [[Venus]], though composed of metallic compounds and occurring at a substantially higher temperature.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

        When moist air tries to dislodge an arctic air mass, overrunning snow can result within the poleward side of the

        Southwest of extratropical cyclones, curved cyclonic flow bringing cold air across the relatively warm water
        bodies can lead to narrow [[lake-effect snow]] bands. Those bands bring strong localized snowfall, which can be
        understood as follows: Large water bodies such as lakes efficiently store heat that results in significant
        temperature differences (larger than 13&nbsp;°C [23&nbsp;°F]) between the water surface and the air above.

        Because of this temperature difference, warmth and moisture are transported upward, condensing into vertically
        oriented clouds (see satellite picture) that produce snow showers. The temperature decrease with height and
        cloud depth are directly affected by both the water temperature and the large-scale environment. The stronger
        the temperature decrease with height, the deeper the clouds get, and the greater the precipitation rate becomes.

        In mountainous areas, heavy snowfall accumulates when air is forced to ascend the mountains and squeeze out
        precipitation along their windward slopes, which in cold conditions, falls in the form of snow. Because of the
        ruggedness of terrain, forecasting the location of heavy snowfall remains a significant challenge.

        These droplets are able to remain liquid at temperatures lower than {{convert|-18|°C|°F|0|lk=on}}, because to

        Once a droplet has frozen, it grows in the supersaturated environment—one where air is saturated with respect to
        ice when the temperature is below the freezing point. The droplet then grows by diffusion of water molecules in
        the air (vapor) onto the ice crystal surface where they are collected. Because water droplets are so much more
        numerous than the ice crystals due to their sheer abundance, the crystals are able to grow to hundreds of
        [[micrometer]]s or millimeters in size at the expense of the water droplets by a process known as the
        Wegner-Bergeron-Findeison process. The corresponding depletion of water vapor causes the ice crystals to grow at
        the droplets' expense. These large crystals are an efficient source of precipitation, since they fall through
        the atmosphere due to their mass, and may collide and stick together in clusters, or aggregates. These
        aggregates are snowflakes, and are usually the type of ice particle that falls to the ground.

        collects on the ground. Types that fall in the form of a ball due to melting and refreezing cycles, rather than

        Once on the ground, snow can be categorized as ''powdery'' when fluffy, ''granular'' when it begins the cycle of
        melting and refreezing, and eventually ''[[ice]]'' once it packs down into a dense drift after multiple melting
        and refreezing cycles. When powdery, snow drifts with the [[wind]] from the location where it originally fell,

        Snow remains on the ground until it [[melting|melts]] or [[sublimation (chemistry)|sublimates]]. Sublimation of

        Once the snow is on the ground, it will settle under its own weight (largely due to differential evaporation)
        until its density is approximately 30% of water. Increases in density above this initial compression occur
        primarily by melting and refreezing, caused by temperatures above freezing or by direct solar radiation. In
        colder climates, snow lies on the ground all winter. By late spring, snow densities typically reach a maximum of
        50% of water.

        ===Snow Water Equivalent (SWE)===
        {{split section|snow water equivalent|date=October 2013}}
        The ''snow water equivalent'' is the product of snow depth and the snow [[bulk density]]. It is a quantity of
        type [[columnar mass density]], having units of [[area density]] (kg/m<sup>2</sup>), though it is usually
        reported normalized by the [[volumetric density]] of [[liquid water]] (units kg/m<sup>3</sup>), thus being
        expressed in units of length (e.g., millimeter or inches). It corresponds to the depth of a layer of water that
        would accumulate in an area, if all the snow and ice were melted in that given area. For example, if the snow
        covering a given area has a water equivalent of {{Convert|sp=us|50|cm|in|0.00}}, then it will melt into a pool
        of water {{Convert|sp=us|50|cm|in|0.00}} deep covering the same area.

        This is a much more useful measurement to [[hydrology|hydrologists]] than snow ''depth'', as the density of cool
        freshly fallen snow widely varies. New snow commonly has a density of around 8% of water. This means that
        {{Convert|sp=us|33|cm|in|0.00}} of snow melts down to {{Convert|sp=us|2.5|cm|in|0.00}} of water.

        Cloud temperatures and physical processes in the cloud affect the shape of individual snow crystals. Highly
        branched or dendritic crystals tend to have more space between the arms of ice that form the snowflake and this
        snow will therefore have a lower density, often referred to as "dry" snow. Conditions that create columnar or
        plate-like crystals will have much less air space within the crystal and will therefore be denser and feel
        "wetter".

        This is due to the trapped air between the individual crystalline flakes, trapping sound waves and dampening
        vibrations. Once it is blown around by the wind and exposed to sunshine, snow hardens and its sound-softening
        quality diminishes.

        The wedge and tipping bucket gauges will have problems with snow measurement. Attempts to compensate for
        snow/ice by warming the tipping bucket meet with limited success, since snow may sublimate if the gauge is kept

        funnel needs to be removed before the event begins.

        Spring snow melt is a major source of water supply to areas in temperate zones near mountains that catch and
        hold winter snow, especially those with a [[Mediterranean climate|prolonged dry summer]]. In such places, water
        equivalent is of great interest to water managers wishing to predict spring [[surface runoff|runoff]] and the
        [[water supply]] of cities downstream. Measurements are made manually at marked locations known as ''snow
        courses'', and remotely using special scales called [[Snow pillow|''snow pillows'']].

        When a snow measurement is made, various networks exist across the United States and elsewhere where rainfall

        Many rivers originating in mountainous or high-latitude regions receive a significant portion of their flow from
        snowmelt. This often makes the river's flow highly seasonal resulting in periodic [[flooding]]

        [[Iran]] and [[Afghanistan]], very low flow for the rest of the year. In contrast, if much of the melt is from
        [[glaciated]] or nearly glaciated areas, the melt continues through the warm season, with peak flows occurring
        in mid to late summer.

        Substantial snowfall can disrupt public infrastructure and services, slowing human activity even in regions that
        are accustomed to such weather. Air and ground transport may be greatly inhibited or shut down entirely.
        Populations living in snow-prone areas have developed various ways to travel across the snow, such as [[ski]]s,
        [[snowshoe]]s, and [[sled]]s pulled by horses, dogs, or other animals and later,
        [[snowmobile]]s.<!-- Nation states, or Americans states? And source for this claim? -- Northern states maintain a fleet of [[snow removal]] equipment to keep roads accessible through winter, but this is not done in the south.-->
        Basic utilities such as [[electricity distribution|electricity]], [[telephone line]]s, and [[Natural
        gas#Uses|gas supply]] can also fail. In addition, snow can make roads much harder to travel and vehicles
        attempting to use them can easily become stuck.

        The combined effects can lead to a "[[Weather-related cancellation|snow day]]" on which gatherings such as
        school or work are officially canceled. In areas that normally have very little or no snow, a snow day may occur
        when there is only light accumulation or even the threat of snowfall, since those areas are unprepared to handle
        any amount of snow. In some areas, such as some states in the United States, schools are given a yearly quota of
        snow days (or "calamity days"). Once the quota is exceeded, the snow days must be made up.

        In some areas with abundant snowfall, such as [[Yamagata Prefecture]], [[Japan]], people harvest snow and store

        methods.

        ===Agriculture===
        Snowfall can be beneficial to agriculture by serving as a [[thermal insulation|thermal insulator]], conserving
        the heat of the Earth and protecting [[agriculture|crops]] from subfreezing weather. Some agricultural areas
        depend on an accumulation of snow during winter that will melt gradually in spring, providing water for crop
        growth. If it melts into water and refreezes upon sensitive crops, such as oranges, the resulting ice will
        protect the fruit from exposure to lower temperatures.

        An avalanche can occur upon a sudden thermal or mechanical impact upon snow that has accumulated on a mountain,
        which causes the snow to rush downhill en masse. Preceding an avalanche is a phenomenon known as an avalanche
        wind caused by the approaching avalanche itself, which adds to its destructive potential.

        During snowmelt, acidic precipitation which previously fell into the snow pack is released, which harms marine
        life.

        There is a popular misconception that snow becomes heavier when it starts to melt, so many people take risks by
        climbing on roofs to remove snow when the weather starts to get warmer, for fear that the roofs will collapse.
        In fact, when snow starts to melt, its volume decreases as the ice crystals and meltwater move into the spaces
        between the crystals, which makes the ''density'' of wet, melting snow greater than that of freshly-fallen snow.
        This makes it feel heavier to shovel, but its mass does not increase. In fact, it decreases when meltwater runs
        off the roof, so the weight of snow on a roof actually decreases when it starts to melt.

        ==Design of structures considering snow load==
        The designs of all structures and buildings use the ground snow [[Structural load|load]]
        <ref name="groundsnowbyzip.com">{{Cite news|url=http://www.groundsnowbyzip.com|title=Ground Snow By Zip (US)}}
        </ref>
        determined by professional engineers and designers. Data on ground snow in the U.S.A. are provided by the
        American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE7-latest edition) for most jurisdictions. This load is typically the
        governing design factor on roofs and structural elements exposed to the effects of snow in the northern United
        States. Closer to the [[Equator]], the snow load becomes less important and may or may not be the governing
        factor.

        ==Extraterrestrial snow==
        Very light snow is known to occur at high latitudes on [[Mars]].

        A "snow" of [[hydrocarbon]]s is also theorized to occur on [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].
        <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/media/cassini-20061212.html|title=Massive Mountain

        While there is little or no water on [[Venus]], there is a phenomenon which is quite similar to snow. The
        [[Magellan probe]] imaged a highly reflective substance at the tops of Venus's highest mountain peaks which bore
        a strong resemblance to terrestrial snow. This substance arguably formed from a similar process to snow, albeit
        at a far higher temperature. Too volatile to condense on the surface, it rose in gas form to cooler higher
        elevations, where it then fell as precipitation. The identity of this substance is not known with certainty, but
        speculation has ranged from elemental [[tellurium]] to lead sulfide ([[galena]]).
