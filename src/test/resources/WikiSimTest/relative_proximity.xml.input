'''Algeria''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Algeria.ogg|æ|l|ˈ|dʒ|ɪər|i|ə}} or {{IPAc-en|ɔː|l|-}}; [[Literary Arabic]]: {{lang|ar|الجزائر}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|al-Jazāʼir}}''&lt;span style=&quot;margin-left:2px&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;; [[Algerian Arabic]],[[Berber languages|Tamazight]]: ''Dzayer,'' ⴷⵣⴰⵢⴻⵔ; {{lang-fr|link=no|Algérie}}&lt;!--French is not official but is in ''de facto'' use in the country, including by the Algerian government, see &quot;Languages of Algeria&quot;--&gt;), officially '''People's Democratic Republic of Algeria''', is a country in the [[Maghreb]] region of [[North Africa]] on the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean coast]]. Its capital and most populous city is [[Algiers]]. With a total area of {{convert|2381741|km2|sqmi|0}}, 90% of which is desert, Algeria is the [[List of countries and dependencies by area|tenth-largest country in the world]], and the largest in Africa and in the Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2147rank.html|title=Country Comparison: Area |publisher=CIA World Factbook |date= |accessdate=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country is bordered in the northeast by [[Tunisia]], in the east by [[Libya]], in the west by [[Morocco]], in the southwest by [[Western Sahara]], [[Mauritania]], and [[Mali]], in the southeast by [[Niger]], and in the north by the [[Mediterranean Sea]].

The territory of today's Algeria was the home of many prehistoric cultures, including [[Aterian]] and [[Capsian culture|Capsian]] and the [[Proto-Berber language|&quot;Proto-Imaziɣen&quot;]] cultures. Its area has known many empires and dynasties, including ancient [[Berber people|Amaziɣ]] [[Numidia]]ns, [[Phoenecians]], Lybio-Punic [[Punic|Carthaginians]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Vandals]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], Arab [[Umayyad]]s, Arab [[Abbasid]]s, Multi-Ethnic [[Fatimid]]s, [[Berber people|Amaziɣ]] [[Almoravids]], [[Berber people|Amaziɣ]] [[Almohads]], [[Ottoman Turks|Turkish]] Ottomans and the [[French Algeria|French colonial empire]]. In recent decades Algeria along with the other nations of the &quot;Desert Belt&quot; has experienced an identity crisis, in response Algeria, along with Morocco, has nationalized [[Tamaziɣt]] the language of its 13,000 year old people.  Algeria is a [[Semi-presidential system|semi-presidential republic]], it consists of 48 provinces and 1541 communes. With a population of 37.9 million, it is the 35th most populated country on Earth. [[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]] has been the [[President of Algeria]] since 1999 and has won four consecutive elections. However, according to the [[Democracy Index]] Algeria is an [[authoritarian regime]].

Algeria's economy is largely based on [[hydrocarbons]], due to which manufacturing has suffered from [[Dutch disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conference.qfis.edu.qa/app/media/304 |title=Poverty and Macroeconomic Development in Algeria: What is the contribution of Oil Revenues? |publisher=Center for Islamic Economics and Finance, Qatar Faculty of Islamic Studies, Qatar Foundation |author=Benbouziane, Mohamed and Benhabib, Abderrezak  |accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country supplies large amounts of [[natural gas]] to Europe and energy exports are the backbone of the economy. According to [[OPEC]] Algeria has [[List of countries by proven oil reserves|17th largest]] reserves of oil in the world, and second largest in [[Africa]], while it has the [[List of countries by natural gas proven reserves|9th largest reserves]] of [[natural gas]]. [[Sonatrach]], the national oil company, is the largest company in Africa.

==Etymology==
The country's name derives from the city of [[Algiers]]. The city's name in turn derives from the Arabic ''al-Jazā'ir'' (الجزائر, &quot;The Islands&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Algeria |title=Online Etymological Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; a truncated form of the older ''Jazā'ir Banī Mazghanna'' (جزائر بني مزغنة, &quot;Islands of the Mazghanna Tribe&quot;),&lt;ref name=idrisi&gt;{{cite book|last=al-Idrisi|first=Muhammad|title=Nuzhat al-Mushtaq|year=12th century}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2013}}&lt;ref name=khaldun&gt;{{cite book|last=Abderahman|first=Abderrahman|title=History of Ibn Khaldun&amp;nbsp;– Volume 6|year=1377}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2013}} employed by medieval geographers such as [[Muhammad al-Idrisi|al-Idrisi]].

===Ancient history===

[[File:Tassili ladies.jpg|thumb|upright|Detail of [[Tassili]] rock paintings dating from about 3000 BC relating a probably lost civilization in what was known as the [[Green Sahara]]]]
In the region of Ain Hanech ([[Saïda Province]]), early remnants (200,000 BC) of hominid occupation in North Africa were found. Neanderthal tool makers produced hand axes in the [[Levallois technique|Levalloisian]] and [[Mousterian]] styles (43,000 BC) similar to those in the [[Levant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gi.ulpgc.es/tarha/Ain_Hanech.pdf |title=The Site of Ain Hanech Revisited: New Investigations at this Lower Pleistocene Site in Northern Algeria |publisher=Journal of Archaeological Science |author=Sahnouni, Mohamed and de Heinzelin, Jean |accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stoneageinstitute.org/ain-hanech.html |title=Research at Ain Hanech, Algeria |publisher=Stoneageinstitute.org |date= |accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Algeria was the site of the highest state of development of [[Middle Paleolithic]] [[Flake tool]] techniques. Tools of this era, starting about 30,000 BC, are called [[Aterian]] (after the archeological site of [[Bir el Ater]], south of [[Tebessa]]).

The earliest blade industries in North Africa are called [[Iberomaurusian]] (located mainly in [[Oran]] region). This industry appears to have spread throughout the coastal regions of the [[Maghreb]] between 15,000 and 10,000 BC. Neolithic civilization (animal domestication and agriculture) developed in the Saharan and Mediterranean Maghreb perhaps as early as 11,000 BC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1002397 |title=Genomic Ancestry of North Africans Supports Back-to-Africa Migrations |publisher=PLOS Genetics |date=2012-01-12 |accessdate=2014-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as late as between 6000 and 2000 BC. This life, richly depicted in the [[Tassili n'Ajjer]] paintings, predominated in Algeria until the classical period.

The amalgam of peoples of North Africa coalesced eventually into a distinct native population that came to be called [[Berber people|Berbers]], who are the indigenous peoples of northern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Berbers|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|year=1997|chapter=Berbers in Antiquity|isbn=978-0-631-20767-2|url=http://books.google.com/?id=8Zcz91t29ukC|author=Brett, Michael; Fentress, Elizabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From their principal center of power at Carthage, the [[Carthaginians]] expanded and established small settlements along the North African coast; by 600 BC, a [[Phoenicia]]n presence existed at [[Tipasa]], east of [[Cherchell]], [[Hippo Regius]] (modern [[Annaba]]) and [[Rusicade]] (modern [[Skikda]]). These settlements served as market towns as well as anchorages.

As Carthaginian power grew, its impact on the indigenous population increased dramatically. Berber civilization was already at a stage in which agriculture, manufacturing, trade, and political organization supported several states. Trade links between Carthage and the Berbers in the interior grew, but territorial expansion also resulted in the enslavement or military recruitment of some Berbers and in the extraction of tribute from others.

[[File:Egypt, Rome, Carthage and Numidia.jpg|thumbnail|right|Numidia along with Egypt, Rome, and Carthage 200 BCE]]

By the early 4th century BC, Berbers formed the single largest element of the Carthaginian army. In the [[Mercenary War|Revolt of the Mercenaries]], Berber soldiers rebelled from 241 to 238 BC after being unpaid following the defeat of Carthage in the [[First Punic War]]. They succeeded in obtaining control of much of Carthage's North African territory, and they minted coins bearing the name Libyan, used in Greek to describe natives of North Africa. The Carthaginian state declined because of successive defeats by the Romans in the [[Punic Wars]].

In 146 BC the city of [[Carthage]] was destroyed. As Carthaginian power waned, the influence of Berber leaders in the hinterland grew. By the 2nd century BC, several large but loosely administered Berber kingdoms had emerged. Two of them were established in [[Numidia]], behind the coastal areas controlled by Carthage. West of Numidia lay [[Mauretania]], which extended across the [[Moulouya River]] in modern day [[Morocco]] to the Atlantic Ocean. The high point of Berber civilization, unequaled until the coming of the [[Almohads]] and [[Almoravids]] more than a millennium later, was reached during the reign of [[Massinissa]] in the 2nd century BC.

After Masinissa's death in 148 BC, the Berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times. Massinissa's line survived until 24 AD, when the remaining Berber territory was annexed to the [[Roman Empire]].

For several centuries Algeria was ruled by the Romans, who founded many colonies in the region. Like the rest of North Africa, Algeria was one of the breadbaskets of the empire, exporting cereals and other agricultural products. The Vandals of [[Geiseric]] moved into North Africa in 429, and by 435 controlled coastal Numidia.&lt;ref name=&quot;vandaf&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cameron|first1=Averil|last2=Ward-Perkins|first2=Bryan|title=The Cambridge Ancient History|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Qf8mrHjfZRoC&amp;pg=RA1-PA124|volume=14|year=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-32591-2|pages=124–126|chapter=Vandal Africa, 429–533}}&lt;/ref&gt; They did not make any significant settlement on the land, as they were harassed by local tribes, in fact by the time the Byzantines arrived Lepcis Magna was abandoned and the Msellata region was occupied by the indigenous [[Amazigh|Laguatan]] who had been busy facilitating an [[Amazigh|Amaziɣ]] political, military and cultural revival.&lt;ref name=&quot;vandaf&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mattingly|first1=D.J.|title=The Laguatan: A Libyan Tribal Confederation in the late Roman Empire.|journal=Libyan Studies|date=1983|volume=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health==
{{Main|Health in Algeria}}
In 2002, Algeria had inadequate numbers of physicians (1.13 per 1,000 people), nurses (2.23 per 1,000 people), and dentists (0.31 per 1,000 people). Access to &quot;improved water sources&quot; was limited to 92% of the population in urban areas and 80% of the population in rural areas. Some 99% of Algerians living in urban areas, but only 82% of those living in rural areas, had access to &quot;improved sanitation&quot;. According to the World Bank, Algeria is making progress toward its goal of &quot;reducing by half the number of people without sustainable access to improved drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015&quot;. Given Algeria's young population, policy favors preventive health care and clinics over hospitals. In keeping with this policy, the government maintains an immunization program. However, poor sanitation and unclean water still cause [[tuberculosis]], [[hepatitis]], [[measles]], [[typhoid fever]], [[cholera]] and [[dysentery]]. The poor generally receive health care free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Algeria.pdf |title=Library of Congress Country Studies – Algeria |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Health records have been maintained in Algeria since 1882 and began adding Muslims living in the South to their Vital record database in 1905 during French rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kemp, Thomas Jay |title=International Vital Records Handbook|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=afnc6_o5AqoC&amp;pg=PA347|year=2009|publisher=Genealogical Publishing Com|isbn=978-0-8063-1793-9|page=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
{{Main|Education in Algeria|List of universities in Algeria}}
[[File:Med Alger.jpg|thumb|[[Algiers]] Medical School]]

Since the 1970s, in a centralized system that was designed to significantly reduce the rate of illiteracy, the Algerian government introduced a decree by which the school became compulsory for all children aged between 6 and 15 years who have the ability to track their learning through the 20 facilities built since independence, now the literacy rate is around 78.7%.&lt;ref name=&quot;illit&quot;/&gt;

Since 1972, Arabic is used as the language of instruction during the first nine years of schooling. From the third year, French is taught and it is also the language of instruction for science classes. The students can also learn English, Italian, Spanish and German. In 2008, new programs at the elementary appeared, therefore the compulsory schooling does not start at the age of six anymore, but at the age of five.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presse-dz.com/revue-de-presse/version-imprimable/1045-les-verites-de-benbouzid.html |title=Ecoles privées, Tamazight, enseignement du Français, syndicats&amp;nbsp;... – Les vérités de Benbouzid |publisher=Presse-dz.com |date= |accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Apart from the 122 private, learning at school, the Universities of the State are free of charge. After nine years of primary school, students can go to the high school or to an educational institution. The school offers two programs: general or technical. At the end of the third year of secondary school, students pass the exam of the Bachelor's degree, which allows once it is successful to pursue graduate studies in universities and institutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.algerie-dz.com/article10808.html |title=Le taux d'analphabétisme en Algérie est de 21,3% |publisher=Algerie-dz.com |date= |accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education is officially compulsory for children between the ages of six and 15. In 2008, the illiteracy rate for people over 10 was 22.3%, 15.6% for men and 29.0% for women. The province with the lowest rate of illiteracy was [[Algiers Province]] at 11.6%, while the province with the highest rate was [[Djelfa Province]] at 35.5%.&lt;ref name=&quot;illit&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Taux d'Analphabétisme et taux d'Alphabétisation de la population âgée de 10 ans et plus selon le sexe et la wilaya de résidence|url=http://www.ons.dz/IMG/pdf/pop9_national.pdf|publisher=Office National des Statistiques}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Algeria has 26 universities and 67 institutions of higher education, which must accommodate a million Algerians and 80,000 foreign students in 2008. The [[University of Algiers]], founded in 1879, is the oldest, it offers education in various disciplines (law, medicine, science and letters). 25 of these universities and almost all of the institutions of higher education were founded after the independence of the country.

Even if some of them offer instruction in [[Arabic]] like areas of law and the economy, most of the other sectors as science and medicine continue to be provided in French and English. Among the most important universities, there are the [[University of Sciences and Technology Houari Boumediene]], the [[University of Mentouri]] Constantine, [[University of Oran]] Es-Senia. Best universities of qualifications remain the [[University of Abou Bekr Belkaïd]] in Tlemcen and [[University of Batna]] Hadj Lakhdar, they occupy the 26th and 45th row in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webometrics.info/en/Africa/Algeria |title=Algeria &amp;#124; Ranking Web of Universities |publisher=Webometrics.info |date= |accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
