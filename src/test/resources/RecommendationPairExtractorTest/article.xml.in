        [[Presley]] studied and played by ear. He also
        frequented record stores with [[jukebox]]es and listening booths. He knew all of [[Hank Snow]]'s
        songs,{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=171}} and he loved records by other country singers such as [[Roy Acuff]], [[Ernest
        Tubb]], [[Ted Daffan]], [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]], [[Jimmie Davis]], and [[Bob
        Wills]].{{sfn|Matthew-Walker|1979|p=3}} The [[Southern gospel]] singer [[Jake Hess]], one of his favorite
        performers, was a significant influence on his ballad-singing style.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=46–48,
        358}}{{sfn|Wadey|2004}} He was a regular audience member at the monthly All-Night Singings downtown, where many
        of the white gospel groups that performed reflected the influence of African-American [[Spiritual
        (music)|spiritual music]].{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=47–48, 77–78}} He adored the music of black gospel singer [[Sister Rosetta Tharpe]].{{sfn|Matthew-Walker|1979|p=3}} Like some of his peers, he may have attended blues
        venues—of necessity, in the [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated South]], on only the nights
        designated for exclusively white audiences.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=51}} He certainly listened to the regional
        radio stations, such as WDIA-AM, that played "race records": spirituals, blues, and the modern, [[Backbeat
        (music)|backbeat]]-heavy sound of [[rhythm and blues]].{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=38–40}} Many of his future
        recordings were inspired by local African-American musicians such as [[Arthur Crudup]] and [[Rufus
        Thomas]].{{sfn|Guralnick|2004}}{{sfn|Bertrand|2000|p=205}} [[B.B. King]] recalled that he had known Presley
        before he was popular, when they both used to frequent Beale Street.{{sfn|Szatmary|1996|p=35}} By the time he
        graduated from high school in June 1953, Presley had already singled out music as his
        future.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=54}}{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=8}}
