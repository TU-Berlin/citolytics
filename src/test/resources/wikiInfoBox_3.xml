        '''Elvis Aaron Presley'''{{refn|Although some pronounce [[Presley|his surname]] ['prɛzli] (PREZ-lee), Presley
        himself used the [[Southern American English]] pronunciation, ['prɛsli] (PRES-lee), as did his family and those
        who worked with him.{{sfn|Elster|2006|p=391}} The correct spelling of his middle name has long been a matter of
        debate. The physician who delivered him wrote "Elvis Aaron Presley" in his ledger.{{sfn|Nash|2005|p=11}} The
        state-issued birth certificate reads "Elvis Aron Presley". The name was chosen after the Presleys' friend and
        fellow congregation member Aaron Kennedy, though a single-A spelling was probably intended by Presley's parents
        in order to parallel the middle name of Presley's stillborn brother, Jesse Garon.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=13}} It
        reads Aron on most official documents produced during his lifetime, including his high school diploma, RCA
        record contract, and marriage license, and this was generally taken to be the proper
        spelling.{{sfn|Adelman|2002|pp=13–15}} In 1966, Presley expressed the desire to his father that the more
        traditional biblical rendering, Aaron, be used henceforth, "especially on legal
        documents".{{sfn|Nash|2005|p=11}} Five years later, the Jaycees citation honoring him as one of the country's
        Outstanding Young Men used Aaron. Late in his life, he sought to officially change the spelling to Aaron and
        discovered that state records already listed it that way. Knowing his wishes for his middle name, Aaron is the
        spelling his father chose for Presley's tombstone, and it is the spelling his estate has designated as
        official.{{sfn|Adelman|2002|pp=13–15}}|name=name|group=lower-alpha}} (January 8, 1935&nbsp;– August 16, 1977)
        was an American musician and actor. Regarded as one of the most significant [[Cultural impact of Elvis
        Presley|cultural icon]]s of the 20th century, he is often referred to as [[Honorific nicknames in popular
        music|"the King of Rock and Roll"]], or simply, "the King".

        Presley was born in [[Tupelo, Mississippi]], as a [[twinless twin]], and when he was 13 years old, he and his
        family relocated to [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. His music career began there in 1954, when he recorded a song with
        producer [[Sam Phillips]] at [[Sun Records]]. Accompanied by guitarist [[Scotty Moore]] and bassist [[Bill
        Black]], Presley was an early popularizer of [[rockabilly]], an uptempo, [[Backbeat (music)|backbeat]]-driven
        fusion of [[country music]] and [[rhythm and blues]]. [[RCA Victor]] acquired his contract in a deal arranged by
        [[Colonel Tom Parker]], who managed the singer for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single,
        "[[Heartbreak Hotel]]", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. He was
        regarded as the leading figure of [[rock and roll]] after a series of successful network television appearances
        and chart-topping records. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style,
        combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines that coincided with the dawn of the
        [[Civil Rights Movement]], made him enormously popular—and controversial.

        In November 1956, he made his film debut in ''[[Love Me Tender (film)|Love Me Tender]]''. In 1958, he was
        drafted into military service. He resumed his recording career two years later, producing some of his most
        commercially successful work before devoting much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and their accompanying
        soundtrack albums, most of which were critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live
        performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed televised comeback special ''[[Elvis (1968 TV
        program)|Elvis]]'', which led to an extended [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] concert residency and a string of
        highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley was featured in the first globally broadcast concert via satellite,
        ''[[Aloha from Hawaii Via Satellite|Aloha from Hawaii]]''. Several years of prescription drug abuse severely
        damaged his health, and he died in 1977 at the age of 42.
