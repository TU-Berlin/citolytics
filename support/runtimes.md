# Average Runtime for Flink Jobs

## Setup

The experiment was performed on a cluster of 10 IBM Power 730 (8231-E2B) servers. Each machine had 2x3.7 GHz POWER7 processors with 6 cores (12 cores in total), 2 x 73.4 GB 15K RPM SAS SFF Disk Drive, 4 x 600 GB 10K RPM SAS SFF Disk Drive and 64 GB of RAM.
We used Apache Flink v0.8 and Hadoop v2.0. The text-based similarity measure was evaluated with Elasticsearch v1.4.2. All versions were the latest stable releases at the time of writing. We used the softwareâ€™s default settings.
